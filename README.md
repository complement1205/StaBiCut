# StaBiCut
This R pipeline performs stability-informed cutoff analysis linking gene expression to patient survival, exemplified on TCGA datasets. It systematically evaluates candidate survival cutoffs across five key criteria: expression distribution, group balance, survival significance, bootstrap stability, tumorâ€“normal consistency, and spline support.
